### Programme expectations

- Help EU programme beneficiaries to comply with FAIR requirements.
- Enable beneficiaries to see benefits of FAIR data.
- Maximize reuse of EU-funded research outputs.

### Expected results

- A new Zenodo-community for the EC's programme beneficaries with a) support for subcommunities for EU-projects and b) identification of programme beneficaries c) visual branding of the EC.
- A workflow to identify a Zenodo user as an EC programme beneficiary.
- A data curation framework that incentivizes programme beneficaries to curate the Zenodo-community supported by automated checks to harmonize curation across beneficaries.
- Integration of FAIR assessment using third-party tools into the deposit form of Zenodo including support for discipline specific metadata/vocabularies.
